# Security Policy

HPL is designed to minimize risk by default.

---

## Tokens

- Authentication uses environment variables
- Tokens are never logged
- Tokens are never written to disk

---

## Telemetry

HPL does not:
- collect usage metrics
- phone home
- embed analytics

---

## Reporting Issues

If you discover a security issue:
- Do not open a public issue
- Contact the maintainers privately

---

## Scope

This policy applies to the CLI only.

API security is handled separately.
